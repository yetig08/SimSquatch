GSPro third party connector for Uneekor Eye Mini Lite using GSPro Open API

To use, select the green code button above, then choose download zip, save to your computer and unzip.  You can then run the setup.exe program to install or run the simsquatch.exe file located in the Application Files/SimSquatch_1_0_0_1 folder.

Start Uneekor View software and GSPro using the Open API Licence.  Once the GSPro connector window is open, start SimSquatch.  
Once the application opens, it will search for the Uneekor folder on your computer, if it has been installed anywhere but C:\Uneekor, you will be prompted to select the location of that folder.
Next, click Start Connection Button and start hitting shots.  

**Note: This application will not put the LM in or out of the putting mode, so, when putting, you will need to select Putter within the View Software and then pick a different club when finished putting.  I reccomend setting up two sessions in View, one with putter as the selected club and one with driver as the selected club, this will allow you to easily switch back and forth while using GSPro, I do plan to automate this in the future if there is enough support for this project.  This is an initail Beta version, so please let me know if you find any issues.
