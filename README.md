GSPro third party connector for Uneekor using GSPro Open API

Version 1.1 is live and includes automated putting mode as well as additional data points for EyeXo, and others...

To use, select the green code button above, then choose download zip, save to your computer and unzip.  Then run the simsquatch.exe file.

Start Uneekor View software and GSPro using the Open API Licence.  Once the GSPro connector window is open, start SimSquatch.  
Once the application opens, it will search for the Uneekor folder on your computer, if it has been installed anywhere but C:\Uneekor, you will be prompted to select the location of that folder.
Next, click Start Connection Button and start hitting shots or use the new putting automation feature by selecting the 'Set View Sessions' options and follow the prompts.  

as in the original version, I can only test on my setup at this time, and error controls are few and far between because I hate that part of coding, so if you do something I didn't think of and it causes an error, please let me know.
